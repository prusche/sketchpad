Odin Project jquery practice

Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs
  create divs using js/jquery, not by hand
  put grids inside a container div
  set up hover effect so that it changes the color of the grid square as the mouse passes over it, leaving a
    pixelated trail through the grid like a pen would (.addClass is a good way to change colors)
  add button at the top of the screen that clears the current grid and creates a popup asking the user how many
    squares per side to make a new grid. However many squares, it should be the same px size as before
  Optional: instead of changing colors from white to black, have each grid square pass through a random rgb value
    then try only adding 10% black per pass through, so that it takes 10 mouse passes to turn the square black
